# Special-Functions
This is a repository of the special functions that widely used in Physical Sciences. <br>
This only serve as a notes for anyone who want to study them. <br>
The most materials from this repository are getting from "Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences", written by Mary L.Boas. <br>

## The Factorial Function
The Factorial Function is given as:
$$\int_{0}^{\infty} x^n e^{-x} dx = n!$$
Boas using a heuristic method to describe how to get the factorial function.<br>
However, the Factorial Function is really a direct result of applying the integration by part, as shown below.
